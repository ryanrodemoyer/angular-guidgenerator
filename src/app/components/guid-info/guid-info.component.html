	<h2>What is a GUID?</h2>
	<p>GUID (or UUID) is an acronym for 'Globally Unique Identifier' (or 'Universally Unique
		Identifier'). It
		is a
		128-bit integer number used to identify resources. The term GUID is generally used by
		developers working
		with
		Microsoft technologies, while UUID is used everywhere else.</p>

	<h2>How unique is a GUID?</h2>
	<p>128-bits is big enough and the generation algorithm is unique enough that if
		1,000,000,000 GUIDs per
		second were
		generated for 1 year the probability of a duplicate would be only 50%. Or if every human
		on Earth
		generated
		600,000,000 GUIDs there would only be a 50% probability of a duplicate.</p>

	<h2>How are GUIDs used?</h2>
	<p>GUIDs are used in enterprise software development in C#, Java, and C++ as database keys,
		component
		identifiers,
		or just about anywhere else a truly unique identifier is required. GUIDs are also used
		to identify all
		interfaces and objects in COM programming.
